## 🚗 Vehicle Parking System – Project Description

The **Vehicle Parking System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and digitize the management of vehicle parking spaces. Developed using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **SQLite** as the database, it leverages **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Jinja2** for the frontend interface and templating.

The application offers **role-based access control** with two main roles: **Admin** and **User**.

### 👤 User Features:
- Sign up and log in securely
- View real-time available parking spots
- Book parking spots instantly
- View and manage past bookings

### 🛠️ Admin Features:
- Log in as admin to access management dashboard
- Add, update, or remove parking lots and individual spots
- Monitor all user bookings in real-time
- Maintain records of space usage and availability

The UI is designed for simplicity and ease of use, ensuring a smooth experience for both end-users and administrators. The system improves efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and helps avoid parking conflicts or overcrowding.

This project is well-suited for **campuses, offices, commercial areas**, and **smart city initiatives**. It can be further extended with features like **QR-based check-ins**, **payment gateway integration**, or **IoT sensor support** for real-time vehicle detection.
